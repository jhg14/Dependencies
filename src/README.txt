In order to compile and run:

javac *.java
java Dependencies [Packages File] [Request0] .. [Requestn]

Where ‘Packages File’ is the file containing the dependencies,
and the requests are the desired dependencies to be returned.

An example of running would be:

java *.java
java Dependencies packages.txt gui swingui
